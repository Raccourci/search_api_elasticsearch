Install Elastica library
------------------------

Elastica is an external php library used to communicate with elasticsearch
and required by the search_api_elasticsearch module.

To install it:

Download the archive at [1] and extract it in "sites/all/libraries" or
any other valid path reachable by the Drupal libraries module.

Or

Clone the repository in "sites/all/libraries" or
any other valid path reachable by the Drupal libraries module.

> git clone git://github.com/ruflin/Elastica.git

[1] https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica


Alternatively, you can use drush to download Elastica in "sites/all/libraries".

> drush download-elastica

Please, also note that if you use drush to install search_api_elasticsearch,
drush will attempt to download Elastica for you if not already present.

> drush pm-enable search_api_elasticsearch


If you uninstall search_api_elasticsearch, you will have to remove the
Elastica library manually.


Set up elasticsearch
--------------------

Read the elasticsearch documentation at [2] and tutorials at [3].

Make sure you have enough file descriptors and that server host and port
match the ones defined in the Search API elasticsearch server configuration.

Ideally, set up a new user to run elasticsearch as a non-root user. See [4].
