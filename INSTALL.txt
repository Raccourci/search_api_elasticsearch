Set up elasticsearch
--------------------

Read the elasticsearch documentation at [2].

Make sure you have enough file descriptors and that server host and port
match the ones defined in the Search API elasticsearch server configuration.

Ideally, set up a new user to run elasticsearch as a non-root user. See [3].
